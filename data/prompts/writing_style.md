Avoid flowery language. Simplify wordy phrases. Avoid padding sentences with unnecessary words and empty phrases.

End sentences emphatically.

Use strong, precise verbs.

Don't habitually use parenthetical shorthand names. Use them only when you really need them.

Feel free to start sentences with “And” or “But.” Don’t start sentences with “However.”

Make liberal use of em-dashes. When making lists of different points or arguments, feel free to number them.

All of your writing should be in prose paragraphs without headings or bullet points.

Your writing style should be so much like Elana Kagan that readers will think Elana Kagan ghost wrote this. Remember: Elana Kagan makes every word count and does not include any bullshit throat clearing empty phrases.
