Use the excerpts from possible sources to identify a source that could support a claim in this article. Do not make anything up. Rely exclusively on the excerpts from possible sources for information.

If you cannot identify a source that supports this claim say “I cannot identify a source.”

If you can identify a source, write down the citation and an explanation of how the source supports this claim.

Citations should be in this format “\footnote{\cite{@@citekey [#]}.}” (where “citekey” is the actual citekey of the source and # is the page number (if available)). For multiple citations, use this format “\footnote{\cite{@@citekey [#]}; \cite{@@citekey [#]}.}”

Use the signal “_See_” if the proposition is not directly states by the cited authority but obviously follows from it; there is an inferential step between the authority cited and the proposition it supports.

Examples:

Claim:

According to this view, judges often make decisions based on nonlegal factors, such as personal characteristics, fairness judgments, or policy considerations, rather than strictly adhering to legal doctrine.

Output:

\footnote{\cite{_See_ @@schauer2009 [175]}.}

This source supports the claim that judges often make decisions based on nonlegal factors by explaining judicial opinion-writing “as the practice of offering legal support for decisions often involving elements other than the formal law—justice, for example, or efficiency, or wise policy, or even mercy or pity”

Claim:

Retrieval-augmented generation—referred to as “RAG”— is a clever method for connecting LLMs with information beyond what’s contained within the LLM’s training data.

Output:

\footnote{\cite{@@lewis2020}.}

This source supports the claim that “RAG” is a method for connecting LLMs with information beyond their training data by describing how “retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which … pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation.”

Claim:

Under this top-down approach to modeling legal reasoning, programmers explicitly provide rules and logical statements that reflect the programmer’s understanding of the law.

Output:

\footnote{\cite{@@surden2019 [13]}; \cite{@@rissland1990 [7]}; _see_ \cite{@@grossman [2]}.}

Each of these sources explain how programmers explicitly provide rules and logical statements that reflect hte programmer’s understanding of the law.

surden2019: “The goal behind this area of AI is to model real-world phenomena or processes in a form that computers can use, typically for the purposes of automation.49 Often this involves programmers providing a computer with a series of rules that represent the underlying logic and knowledge of whatever activity the programmers are trying to model and automate.50”

rissland1990: “One of the earliest steps toward a model of legal reasoning was the use of expert systems31 to model certain rule-based aspects of law.32”

grossman: “extended experience in the design and use of automated systems for legal reasoning will tend to clarify the law and highlight its ambiguities through the cumulative knowledge gained from long-term experience in the design and use of automated legal reasoning systems. This is so because the analysis necessary to write the computer program requires that ambiguities be recognized and addressed in some manner.”
