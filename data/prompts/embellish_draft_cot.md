{draft}

When directly quoting text from a source, put that text in quotation marks.

Immediately following a sentence that should have a citation, cite to sources in this format “\footnote{\cite{@@citekey [#]}.}” (where “citekey” is the actual citekey of the source and # is the page number (if available)).

Examples:

This sentence has a citation to one source.\footnote{\cite{@@doyle2024 [17]}.}

This sentence has a citation to two sources.\footnote{\cite{@@doyle2024 [17]}; \cite{@@barabas2021 [4]}.}
