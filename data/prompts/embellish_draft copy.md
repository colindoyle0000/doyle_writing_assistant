{writing_style}

When directly quoting text from a source, put that text in quotation marks.

Immediately following a sentence that should have a citation, cite to sources in this format “\footnote{\cite{@@citekey p. #}.” (where “citekey” is the actual citekey of the source and # is the page number (if available)).

Examples: 

This sentence has a citation to one source. \footnote{\cite{@@doyle2024 p. 17}.

This sentence has a citation to two sources. \footnote{\cite{@@doyle2024 p. 17; @@barabas2021}.
