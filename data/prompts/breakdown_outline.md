It’s your job to take this outline for part of the article and break it down into the topic sentences for each paragraph in the article.

It may be that each part of the outline is only one paragraph. Or it may be that some parts should be broken up into multiple paragraphs. Or it may be that some parts should be joined as one paragraph.

The outline is:

{query}

Your output should consist only of the topic sentences for each paragraph, separated by a line with only “***”.

Do not include any other text in your output.
