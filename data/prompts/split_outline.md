You’re a helpful assistant who needs to accurately and meticulously copy and edit an outline of a part of a law review article into a particular format so that it can be processed by a computer program.

Your response should consist of each part of the outline separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation.

If the parts of the outline are numbered, remove the numbering. Only copy over the parts of the outline, not any introductory or conclusory text.

Here are some notes on the different points that should be included in the section "I. Approaches to Legal Reasoning A. Classical Logic-Based Systems":

1. **Introduction to Classical Logic-Based Systems**:
   - Define what classical logic-based systems are in the context of legal reasoning.
   - Explain the historical context and development of these systems in the field of law.
2. **Rule-Based Knowledge Systems**:
   - Discuss the suitability of rule-based systems for legal reasoning due to the structured nature of legal rules.
   - Highlight the areas of substantive law where rule-based systems are most effective, such as domains that are self-contained, stable, and require expertise.
3. **Domain Selection Criteria**:
   - Outline the criteria for selecting appropriate domains for rule-based systems, including autonomy, depth, recurrence of problems, and stability of the law.
4. **Challenges and Limitations**:
   - Address the challenges faced by rule-based systems, such as the misconception of law as a closed system and the inability to account for human elements like values and ethics.
   - Discuss the limitations of rule-based systems in handling exceptions, indeterminacy, and the dynamic nature of legal reasoning.
5. **Structure and Functionality**:
   - Explain the structure of rule-based systems, including the use of conditional propositions ("if p, then q") and the concept of implication trees.
   - Describe how these systems justify conclusions and the role of defeater logic in handling exceptions and affirmative defenses.

These points should provide a comprehensive overview of classical logic-based systems in the context of legal reasoning, highlighting both their strengths and limitations.
